This is a simple IoT based group project which aims to overcome the difficulties faced in the current manpower based parking systems. Here the user gets information regarding the parking slot availability at the entry point itself which saves the effort and valuable time of the users by avoiding them to find a parking space for their vehicles. This quality of the project makes it more time-efficient and effort-saving than the conventional parking systems.
